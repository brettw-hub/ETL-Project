1,Private,,,Y,1982-03-19,"Leesburg, Florida",Beechcraft Bonanza F35,3.0,3.0,"Randy Rhoads, 25, lead guitarist for heavy metal star Ozzy Osbourne was killed when the plane in which he was a passenger crashed into a tour bus and a house. The pilot was attempting to buzz Osbourne's tour bus when after several attempts, the left wing struck the side of the bus puncturing it in two places approximately half way down the right side.  The plane was thrown over the bus, hit a pine tree, severing it approximately 10 feet up from the bottom, before it crashed into the garage of a  house. The plane was an estimated 10-11 feet off the ground traveling at approximately 120 - 150 knots during final impact. Several other members of the group were inside the bus but were not hurt. The pilot,  Andrew Aycock's medical certificate (3rd class) had expired, making his pilots license invalid. All three aboard, Rhoads, Rachel Youngblood, the groups hairdresser and the pilot were killed. Poor judgement by the pilot in buzzing the bus and misjudging clearance of obstacles."
1,Private,,,Y,1985-12-31,"De Kalb, Texas",Douglas DC-3,9.0,7.0,"The plane crash landed into a field and struck a pole then continued into trees after dense smoke filled the plane and cockpit. The fire most likely started in a defective cabin heater but was not determined for sure. Singer Rick Nelson, 45, fianc√©e Helen Blair, 27, soundman Clark Russell and the members of his back-up group The Stone Canyon Band, Andy Chapin, 20, Rick Intveld, 22, Bobby Neal, 38, and Patrick Woodward, 35 were killed. Both pilots survived after climbing out the cockpit windows. Nelson had purchased the DC-3 in May 1985 from Jerry Lee Lewis and the craft had been forced to make two emergency landings in the previous six months. Nelson and his band were en route to perform at the half-time festivities at the Cotton Bowl."
1,Private,,,Y,1989-08-13,"Janice, Mississippi",Cessna 177RG,2.0,2.0,"The aircraft was flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport.

1,Private,,,Y,1991-04-04,"Marion, Pennsylvania",Piper Aerostar 601 / Bell 412SP,5.0,5.0,"When the plane's nose gear indicator light did not illuminate a helicopter was dispatched to verify the nose gear was down. While making the inspection, the helicopter's blades accidentally hit the bottom of the plane sending both aircraft into the ground, killing all aboard both aircraft. Pennsylvania Senator H. John Heinz III was killed in the crash along with two children playing outside an elementary school. Two killed aboard the Bell and 3 aboard the Piper. The poor judgment by the captain of the airplane to permit the in-flight inspection after he had determined to the best of his ability that the nose landing gear was fully extended. The poor judgment of the captain of the helicopter to conduct the inspection and the failure of the flight crew of the helicopter to maintain safe separation."
1,Private,,,Y,1993-04-01,"Blountville, Tennesee",Fairchild SA227-TT,4.0,4.0,"The Hooters Restaurant private plane crashed 0.5 miles outside the Outer Marker while attempting to land at the Tri-Cities airport near Bristol, Tennessee. NASCAR Winston Cup Champion Alan Kulwicki, 38, killed. Failure of the pilot to follow procedures concerning use of the engine inlet anti-icing system while operating  in icing conditions, which resulted in ice ingestion and loss of engine power. Failure of the pilot to maintain airspeed while coping with the engine problem."
1,Private,,,Y,1993-04-19,"Zwingle, Iowa",Mitsubishi MU-2B-60,8.0,8.0,"While cruising at FL240, a fracture of the propeller hub resulted in the separation of a propeller blade and damage to the engine, nacelle, wing and fuselage causing significant degradation to aircraft performance.

1,Private,,,Y,1993-07-12,"Talladega, Alabama","Helicopter, Hughes 369HS",2.0,1.0,"The helicopter crashed while attempting to land in a confined area of the infield of the Talladega Super Speedway. The pilot of the helicopter, NASCAR race car driver Davey Allison, 30, killed. The pilot's poor in-flight decision to land downwind in a confined area that was surrounded by high obstructions, and his failure to properly compensate for the tailwind condition."
1,Private,,,Y,1996-04-11,"Cheyenne, Wyoming",Cessna 177B,3.0,3.0,"Seven- year-old trainee pilot, Jessica Dubroff, accompanied by her father (a passenger) and the pilot-in-command, were engaged in a trans-continental record attempt involving 6,660 miles of flying in 8 consecutive days. The plane departed towards a nearby thunderstorm in deteriorating weather. Witnesses describe the plane's climb rate and speed as slow and they observed the aircraft enter a roll consistent with a stall. The plane's gross weight was 84 pounds over the maximum limit. Pilot's improper decision to take off into deteriorating weather conditions when the airplane was overweight resulting in stall caused by failure to maintain airspeed."
1,Private,,,Y,1997-08-10,"100 miles SW of Kuujjuaq, Quebec, Canada",Cessna 180K,2.0,2.0,"French Canadian actress Marie-Soleil Tougas, 27, and  film director Jean-Claude Lauzon, 43, were killed when their Cessna crashed into a mountainside in strong winds and rain. They were returning from a fishing trip. While the cause of the accident is officially listed as unable to determine, an unexplained distraction and/or the effects of an optical illusion may have contributed to distracting the pilot's attention from flying the circuit."
1,Private,,,Y,1997-10-12,"Monterey Bay, near PacifiGrove, California",Rutan Long EZ (experimental aircraft),1.0,1.0,"The aircraft had just finished performing 3 touch-and-go landings at Monterey Peninsula Airport. Shortly after taking off a fourth time, witnesses heard the engine make popping noises, bank to the right, pitch up, and go into a steep dive from about a  500 foot altitude and crash into the sea about 150 yards offshore. Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot's left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane's right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge."
1,Private,,,Y,1998-11-21,"Edgewater, Maryland",Burgess RV-6 experimental,1.0,1.0,"The homebuilt plane was attempting to land at Lee Airport in Maryland when it crashed into Beard's Creek.  coming to rest  inverted in 18 feet of water. Actor, William Gardner Knight, 56, who was piloting the aircraft was killed. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate altitude/clearance from the trees. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's unfamiliarity with the geographilocation and dark night conditions."
1,Private,,,Y,1999-07-16,"Off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts",Piper PA-32-R301 Saratoga II HP,3.0,3.0,"The aircraft, piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr., 38, crashed into the sea approximately 34 miles west of Martha's Vineyard while en route from Fairfield, New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Killed along with Kennedy were his wife Carolyn and her sister Lauren Bessette. Kennedy's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Contributing factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night."
1,Private,,,Y,1999-07-31,"Marine City, Michigan",Beech King Air 65-A90,10.0,10.0,"The aircraft, which was carrying members of a skydiving club, crashed shortly after taking off from Marine City Airport. Witnesses reported the plane banked hard to the right and flew into the ground. The aircraft was destroyed by fire. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed, which resulted in a stall, inflight loss of control and collision with the ground."
1,Private,,,Y,2000-10-16,"Hillsboro, Missouri",Cessna 335,3.0,3.0,"The twin engine Cessna crashed into a densely wooded area, 30 miles south of St. Louis, 25 minutes after taking off from Parks Airport. The plane was flying in rain and fog when the pilot reported he was at 6,500 feet and having problems with the artificial horizon. Radar contact was soon lost with the aircraft.  Witnesses reported hearing a plane in a dive followed by an explosion.  Wreckage was scattered over a wide area.  Mel Carnahan, 66, Governor of Missouri was killed in the accident along with a campaign aide and his son, Roger, who was piloting the plane."
1,Private,,,Y,2002-04-24,"Near Olancho, Honduras",Cessna 206G,6.0,6.0,"The aircraft crashed in the El Urracal mountains, 12 miles from the runway were it took off at El Aguacate Air Force base. The wreckage of the airplane was in a box canyon on the east side of the 45-degree sloping terrain at an elevation of 3,500 feet. Those aboard were surveying the Patruca jungle on a conservation project. Among those killed were three mayors from cities in the region. Observers on the ground reported the plane was on fire before it crashed."
1,Private,,,Y,2002-04-28,"Near Abakan, Russia",Mi-8 helicopter,20.0,8.0,"The helicopter struck power lines and crashed in near-zero visibility. Governor of Krasnoyarsk territory, Alexander Lebed, 52, was among those killed. 'Power line, power line!' were the last words of the pilot. Thick fog concealing a frost-covered power line led to the helicopter crash."
1,Private,,,Y,2002-07-04,"San Dimas, California",Cessna 310,2.0,2.0,"The aircraft lost power while taking off from Bracket Airport and crashed into picnickers on the shoreline of Puddingstone Lake in Bonelli Park. The plane was observed in a left bank, traveling approximately 30 feet above and parallel to the shoreline, before impacting two trees in a picniarea. Witnesses reported that they did not hear the engines running. The pilot made 3 consecutive mayday calls during the initial climb-out from runway 26L, however, the pilot did not indicate the nature of the emergency.  Two children on the ground were killed. Fifteen others were injured. The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall, and subsequent collision with terrain. A contributing factor was the pilot's impairment from the effects of prescription painkilling drugs."
22,Aloha Airlines,AAH,United States,Y,1988-04-28,"Maui, Hawaii",Boeing B-737-297,95.0,1.0,The aircraft suffered separation of the top of the fuselage resulting in explosive decompression and severe structural damage. A flight attendant was sucked out of the opening in the fuselage and her body never recovered. The plane made a safe emergency landing at Kahuiui Airport on Maui. Failure of Aloha Airline's maintenance program to detect the presence of disbonding and fatigue damage which led to failure of the lap joint at S-10L and the separation of the fuselage upper lobe. Contributing factors were the failure of Aloha Airline's management to properly supervise its maintenance crew as well as the failure of the FAA to properly evaluate the Aloha Airlines maintenance program and to assess the airline's inspection and quality control deficiencies. In addition the maintenance program underestimated the need for inspections with the large number of pressurizations/depressurizations and humid salt air climate the plane was subjected to.
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,1976-04-27,"St. Thomas, Virgin Islands",Boeing B-727-95,88.0,37.0,"After touching down 2,200 feet down the runway, a go-around procedure was initiated. When there was no acceleration felt, the throttles were closed again. After attaining a nose-up attitude of 11 degrees, the aircraft ran off the end of the runway and struck a localizer antenna. The wingtip then clipped a hillside, the aircraft hit an embankment, went airborne and contacted the ground bursting into flames. The captain's actions and his judgement in initiating a go-around manoeuver with insufficient runway remaining after a long touchdown."
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,1979-05-25,"Chicago O'Hare, Illinois",McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10,271.0,271.0,"During takeoff just, as the plane lifted from the runway, the left engine and pylon separated from the aircraft damaging the wing and hydraulisystem which caused the aircraft to roll and crash. Highest single plane death toll in U.S. aviation history. Asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems caused by separation of the engine and pylon. Improper maintenance procedures used by American Airlines when dismounting the engines for maintenance, by removing the pylon and engine together, putting strain on the engine mounts leading to  stress cracks."
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,1979-11-15,"Near Chicago, Illinois",Boeing B-727,78.0,0.0,"While en route from Chicago to Washington an explosive device detonated in the baggage compartment. The aircraft was flying at an altitude of approximately 34,500 feet, when the flight crew experienced a noise which they described as a thump. Smoke subsequently filled the cabin and the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Washington-Dulles Airport. The bomb was planted by the Unabomber, a man who had been accused of attacks over an 18-year period. He was arrested in April 1996 and subsequently received a life sentence."
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,1985-04-16,"Las Cruces, New Mexico",Boeing B-727-227,89.0,0.0,While cruising at FL 350 a loud noise was heard followed by a severe jolt. The No. 3 engine separated from the aircraft. A damaged O ring allowed leakage from the forward lavatory waste drain valve. Four gallons of fluid leaked and froze on the exterior of the plane and then broke away in chunks and smashed into the engine. They plane landed safely.
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,1995-12-20,"Near Buga, Valle del Cauca, Colombia",Boeing B-757-223,164.0,160.0,"While on a flight from Miami, FL to Cali, Columbia the aircraft crashed into Mt. El Deluvio 38 miles north of Cali while attempting to land. On approach, the crew was requested to report over Tulua VOR which they already passed. This confused them and they decided to go direct to Rozo beacon. Entering the abbreviation 'R', incorrectly steered the plane towards Bogota. More than a minute into the  turn the crew steered manually toward Cali, but this now took them into the path of a mountain. Crew error. Lack of situational awareness, failure to adequately plan and execute the approach, failure to realize that the FMS had turned the aircraft toward mountains. Crew also neglected to retract the speed brakes after the Ground Proximity Warning System alert.  Lack of adequate radar. Different  Flight Management System naming convention from that published in navigational charts."
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,1999-06-01,"Little Rock, Arkansas",McDonnell Douglas MD-82,145.0,11.0,"The plane was on a flight from Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas to Little Rock, Arkansas. While attempting to land at Little Rock Airport, the flight encountered heavy thunderstorms, rain and strong winds. The aircraft landed fast and hard, skidded off the end of the runway and struck a landing light tower, breaking into three parts and bursting into flames. Crew's decision to continue the approach despite severe thunderstorms in the area and crosswinds that  exceeded American Airlines' guidelines. The crew did not arm the automatispoiler system before landing or manually deploy the spoilers after touchdown. Fatigue, the crew had been awake for nearly 16 hours."
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,2000-11-20,"Miami, Florida",Airbus A300-600R,114.0,1.0,"After climbing through 16,000 ft. the crew descovered cabin pressure could not be maintained and returned to the airport.  After landing the ram air switch failed to depressurize the aircraft. Moments later the left foreward door exploded open ejecting a flight attendant onto the tarmac."
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,2001-09-11,"Arlington, Virginia.",Boeing B-757-223,64.0,64.0,The aircraft was hijacked after taking off from Dulles International Airport. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the Pentagon. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day.
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,2001-09-11,"New York City, New York",Boeing 767-223ER,92.0,92.0,"The aircraft was hijacked shortly after it left Logan International Airport in Boston. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the north tower of the World Trade Center between the 94th and 99th floors at approximately 450 mph.  After 102 minutes, the building collapsed. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day."
24,American Airlines,AAL,United States,Y,2001-11-12,"Belle Harbor, Queens, New York",Airbus A-300-605R,260.0,260.0,"Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistiand exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed."
28,Asiana Airlines,AAR,Republic of Korea,Y,1993-07-26,"Haenam, South Korea",Boeing B-737-5L9,110.0,68.0,The aircraft hit Mt. Ungeo at 800 ft. while on approach after two missed landing attempts in high winds and heavy rain. Captain's decision to land in weather that had fallen below minima.
49,Airborne Express,ABX,United States,N,1990-01-29,"Burlington, Vermont",Cessna 208B Caravan I,2.0,2.0,"In light snow, the cargo plane was unable to gain altitude and crashed into trees. The failure of the pilot to de-ice the airplane prior to departure, and his decision to make the takeoff at a weight that exceeded both the maximum structural takeoff weight and the reduced takeoff weight allowed for icing conditions resulting in an inadvertent stall."
49,Airborne Express,ABX,United States,N,1996-12-22,"Narrows, Virginia",McDonnell Douglas DC-8-63F,6.0,6.0,"The cargo struck mountainous terrain after experiencing a stall during tests. The inappropriate control inputs applied by the flying pilot during a stall recovery attempt, the failure of the non-flying pilot-in-command to recognize, address and correct these inappropriate control inputs, and the failure of Airborne Express to establish a formal, functional evaluation flight program that included adequate program guidelines, requirements and pilot training for performance of these flights. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the inoperative stick shaker stall warning system and Airborne Express DC-8 flight training simulator's inadequate fidelity in reproducing the airplane's stall characteristics."
76,ADC Airlines,ADK,Nigeria,N,1997-07-29,"Calabar , Nigeria",BAC One-Eleven 203AE,55.0,1.0,Overshot the runway in heavy rain and came to rest in brush.

Radio transmissions from the plane indicated the pilots were struggling with a jammed stabilizer for the last 11 minutes of the flight before nose-diving into the sea. While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophieffects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed."

After a missed approach and during  a go-around, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a wooded area. The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term 'we need priority' several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say 'we are running out of fuel' numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted. Although the major blame was placed on the crew, in the end, the FAA paid 40% of compensations to the passenger's families."

The captain may have suffered a 'spatial disorientation' to ground warning systems, which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input, resulting in the aircraft starting to descend, when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude."

He flew north at an altitude beneath minimum radar coverage. The plane impacted the frozen ArctiOcean in a right bank and at a 60 degree nose-down attitude. The pilot's intentional VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions and his failure to maintain altitude and clearance from terrain. A contributing factor was the weather conditions.

As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromos, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control was left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing."

Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner."

The crew then advised ATC that the left engine had been shut down because it was on fire. The crew decided to proceed to Mirabel International Airport. Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulifluid. When hydraulifluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulisystem. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was. The left wing was weakened by the wing/engine fire and failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable."

The plane touched down at 182 knots, 2,150 feet past the runway threshold, too fast and too far down the runway for the plane to stop in time.  In the accident sequence,  the nose gear collapsed, the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane and  the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed. Two passengers sustained serious injuries and 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries. The flightcrew's excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller's positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flightcrew other than a go-around maneuver."

Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C."

The right wing and parts of the rudder separated from the aircraft before it crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet's cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain.
